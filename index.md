# Annie Griner
**Senior Insights Analyst**

I design executive-ready dashboards that turn complex data into clear, actionable decisions.

---

## What I Do
I specialize in building analytics experiences that help leaders understand what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what to do next.

My work focuses on:
- Power BI dashboards for executive and operational audiences  
- Data storytelling that reduces misinterpretation and bias  
- Metrics design that aligns analytics with real business decisions  



## Selected Work
A small collection of projects that show how I approach problems, design dashboards, and communicate insights.

- **Perception vs Reality: Jeep Wrangler Sales** *(coming soon)*
  A behavioral analytics case study exploring confirmation bias and how data challenges intuition.

- **Customer Retention & Revenue Risk** *(coming soon)*  
  An executive dashboard designed to identify churn risk and prioritize action.



## How I Work
I approach analytics with a few core principles:
- Start with the decision, not the chart  
- Prioritize clarity over complexity  
- Design for the audience, not the analyst  
- Treat perception as a signal — and data as the test
